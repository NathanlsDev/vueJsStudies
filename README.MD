# Intro to Vue 2 | Vue Mastery School
## Lesson 1 - The Vue Instance
### What have we learned?
- How to begin writing a Vue application with a Vue instance, and how to load basic data onto the webpage.
- The Vue instance is the root of every Vue application
- The Vue instance plugs into an element in the DOM
- The Vue instance’s data can be displayed using the mustache-like syntax {{ }} called an expression.
- Vue is reactive

## Lesson 2 - Attribute Binding
- Data can be bound to HTML attributes.
- Syntax is v-bind: or : for short.
- The attribute name that comes after the : specifies the attribute we’re binding data to.
- Inside the attribute’s quotes, we reference the data - we’re binding to.
