# Intro to Vue 2 | Vue Mastery School
## Lesson 1 - The Vue Instance
### What have we learned?
- How to begin writing a Vue application with a Vue instance, and how to load basic data onto the webpage.
- The Vue instance is the root of every Vue application
- The Vue instance plugs into an element in the DOM
- The Vue instance’s data can be displayed using the mustache-like syntax {{ }} called an expression.
- Vue is reactive

## Lesson 2 - Attribute Binding
- Data can be bound to HTML attributes.
- Syntax is v-bind: or : for short.
- The attribute name that comes after the : specifies the attribute we’re binding data to.
- Inside the attribute’s quotes, we reference the data - we’re binding to.

## Lesson 3 - Conditional rendering
- There are Vue directives to conditionally render elements:
  - v-if
  - v-else-if
  - v-else
  - v-show
- If whatever is inside the directive’s quotes is truthy, the element will display.
- You can use expressions inside the directive’s quotes.
- V-show only toggles visibility, it does not insert or remove the element from the DOM.
